      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I started going to college for Computer Engineering but after taking several of the core classes, it wasn't something that I wanted to get into. I really excelled at programming but I didn't want to go through 4 years of college to get there so I spoke with a few developers and they told me about these bootcamps and here I am.</p>
